# final_project_source

This is a repository for the final project for Neural Networks class.

getFreq.m... to get the Fourier Transform of the raw data and then average frequencies you want (you dont't have to average)
data_method.py... to convert matlab file and then make apropriate labels. 
multi_class_svm.py... to run multi-class svm. Codes were mostly taken from scikit-learn tutorial for multi-class svm
plot_learning_curve.py... to plot the learning curve of muti-class svm. 

To run codes above, put each data under same directory with other python scripts.
*You have to use the data_method.py 
data/average...  average data on 3 different frequencies (4-7, 8-13, 16-31)
data/each...  data without averaging on range (9 – 14, 18 – 26)
